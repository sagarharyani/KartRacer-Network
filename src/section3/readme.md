* JDK 16 was used in development.
* GameServer.java is used to run the game server.
* The server has a transcript that shows the communication log in a human readable form, to assist debugging.
* GameClient.java is used to run a client.
 
When a client is not connected to the server, the player can still play around alone with their own kart. <br>As soon as the client connects to the server, the kart positions are updated according to the other players connected to the server.

The game can be used for multiple clients, but currently only upto two clients have been tested.
